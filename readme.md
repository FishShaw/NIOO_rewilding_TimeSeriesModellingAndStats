# 🌿 Quantifying Rewilding Impact: Statistical Analysis & Ecological Resilience Modeling

**Master's Research Internship | Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) | Advanced Data Analytics**

*This repository contains the **second phase** of my master's internship project: comprehensive statistical analysis, ecological resilience modeling, and automated reporting pipelines. The first phase (satellite data preprocessing) can be found [here](https://github.com/FishShaw/NIOO_rewilding_GEEDownloadingAndCloudMask).*

## 📈 Key Scientific Discoveries

### 🔍 **Resilience Patterns Discovered**
- **Late-started rewilded areas** show significantly higher recovery rates to flood events (p < 0.001)
- **Agricultural lands** exhibit 40% lower resistance to drought compared to natural areas
- **Optimal recovery window**: 12-month period shows strongest predictive power across all metrics
- **Management age effect**: Rewilding sites with 15+ years show enhanced ecological stability

### 📊 **Statistical Model Performance**
- **High explanatory power**: Best models achieve R² > 0.75 for resilience predictions
- **Robust significance patterns**: 23 out of 108 models show significant effects (p < 0.05)
- **Cross-validation stability**: Consistent results across different time windows and event types
- **Effect size quantification**: Large practical differences between management strategies
